## Final Report

All team members must collectively write a final report.  The final report should be persuasive, convincing those who read it that the team has designed and implemented a successful project. The team should use as much evidence as they can (i.e., testing results and flight data / comparisons) to help convince the audience.  The final report should be written as a memo, and directed towards the teaching staff. Please note that all words in the sentences above are really important, paying particular attention to "convincing", "designed", and "implemented".  This requires documentation of these things - the teaching staff is not going to look back at posters or PDRs or labs to see the design and/or implementation. The final report should be a self-contained document that should document all aspects of the project!

We specifically are not providing minimum / maximum page counts or requirement on sections.  We are looking to see if your team makes a convincing argument that is backed up by data.
