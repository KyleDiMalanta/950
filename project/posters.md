## Poster Presentation

All team members must collectively design, create, and present a poster.  The poster should be persuasive, convincing those who look at it that their project was successful. Teams should be able to highlight the aspects of their project (images, CAD drawings, diagrams, budgets, test results, flight results) that convinces their audience (other class members, teaching staff, deans, etc.) that their project was a success. The specification of this is vague.  You need to figure out how to spin your poster and what to present to convince us that your ENGR100 experience was a success. Hint: engineers like facts.


The size and characteristics of the poster are provided in discussion.
