# Lab 6 Prelab: Altium Schematic to PCB

<div class="primer-spec-callout danger" markdown="1">
This is the first lab completed as a team! As such, the amount of work needed to complete it is slightly higher than previous labs. The completion of this lab will be made MUCH easier if you carefully read through this manual and complete it in steps.
